# Landing Page (The Odin Project)

:computer: The "Odin Landing Page" project is part of the Foundations. Specifically, the last lesson of **Flexbox**, which is basically in CSS.

:bulb: In this project, we had to create an entire web page from a design that was provided.

> 2 images, one had the webpage design and one had the colours, font-sizes, etc.

:fountain_pen: The skills that were used in this project were:
- HTML
- CSS (decoration, and **flexbox** usage)

> Sidenote: I wouldn't consider the web-page fully completed since I'm using placeholder text and images for the most part
